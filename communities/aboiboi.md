### Agriculture 
The main crops are cassava, groundnuts, sesame (sim sim), and millet. The MFP is primarily used for hulling maize and rice.

### Background 
Before the MFP was brought to Aboiboi, the community members would travel to Soroti (32 km, or 6 hours walking) to process their maize and rice, and to Katakwi (45 km, or 9 hours walking) to process cassava. In anticipation of the intallment of the MFP, Aboiboi began growing much more rice, which can be hulled and sold in the market.

### Impact
Since it became operational, Aboiboi's MFP has generated 100,000 shillings in profit (~$ USD). They also plan to begin a program to loan money to group members, with interest.
